<p> In this project, we created a model to capture car's number plate and recognize characters on number plate of the vehicle(car).</p>
<p> With the help of RTO's API, it is able to fetch information about the owner of that vehicle.</p>
<p> After fetching the information, it redirects the information on the web portal.</p>
